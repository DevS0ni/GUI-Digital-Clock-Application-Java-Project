# GUI Digital Clock Application (JAVA Project)

*Project Description*
```
* The project is a basic digital clock application that utilizes Java's Swing library
  to create a graphical user interface.
* The clock continuously updates itself and displays the current time in a simple
  window with minimal styling. 
* The use of threading ensures that the clock updates in real-time without freezing
  the entire application.
* The clock is displayed within a JFrame (window). The clock is presented in a standalone
  window with a specific size and position on the screen.
```

*Technologies & Tools Used for the Project*
```
- Microsoft Visual Studio (Windows)
- VS Code (Windows & Mac OSX)
- NetBeans Java IDE
```

*Academic Honesty/ Integrity Statement*

I declare that the code in this repository is entirely my own work.

NOTE: For others, this repo can be a good reference, if someone wants to learn &
understand the aspects of JAVA programming and it's topic but must not copy the
work completed by me!
