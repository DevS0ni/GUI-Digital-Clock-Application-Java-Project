# GUI Digital Clock Application (JAVA Project)
```
* The project is a basic digital clock application that utilizes Java's Swing library
  to create a graphical user interface.
* The clock continuously updates itself and displays the current time in a simple
  window with minimal styling. 
* The use of threading ensures that the clock updates in real-time without freezing
  the entire application.
* The clock is displayed within a JFrame (window). The clock is presented in a standalone
  window with a specific size and position on the screen.
